% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
The suggester functionality is an important feature of modern search engines. The aim of the thesis is to implement
it for the OpenGrok project. OpenGrok search engine is based on Apache Lucene and supports its query syntax.
Presented suggester implementation supports this query syntax and provides suggestions not only for the prefixes but
also for wildcards, regular expressions, or phrases. The implementation also takes into account the possibility of
grouping queries. That means, if one query is already specified and user is typing another query, then the first
query will restrict the suggestions for the second query. The promotion of specific suggestions is based on the
underlying Lucene index data structure and most popular completion.
